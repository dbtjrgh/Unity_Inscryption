  bodyText1: OK I need to write this down NOW so I don't go to sleep and tell myself I dreamt it.
  bodyText2: I'm working late and testing the latest build and out of nowhere The Angler starts FREAKING OUT. Like he pulled something up out of the river with his hook then he GETS UP and WALKS. There is no walk animation for this character! WTF?! He walked right into the cabin. I followed him in and couldn't find him. Leshy had some new dialogue lines that I CANNOT FIND IN THE DIALOGUE FILE. He said something about some OLD_DATA and how The Angler served him well or something.
  bodyText3: I'm so tired that I'm already wondering if I made this up.
