  bodyText1: Last night I brought the disk with me on a walk around the seawall and was THIS close to just chucking it out into the water.
  bodyText2: If I'm right the Karnoffel Code is still out there and the machine is, incredibly, still ready to accept it. Destroy the disk, no one finds the Code, and no one can blow up half of Europe. Right? But I saw an otter which made me think of Leshy. Maybe we need the Code to DISarm the machine? Could that be right? I can't be sure.
  bodyText3: I went home.
