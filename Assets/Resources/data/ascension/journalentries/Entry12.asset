  bodyText1: Call from Mr. Kaminski at 9:45 pm. What the hell is wrong with this guy? He wants all the sample disks back at the factory NOW. What does he know? NAH TICK MASS he kept saying.
  bodyText2: I'm done with all of this but I can't bring myself to destroy this disk, I'm sorry. I've got a little wooden box and I'm gonna bury it with the disk inside. I'm writing the coords down and who knows maybe I'll burn them later. Leshy will thank me. The world may not.
  bodyText3: Goodbye for now <3
