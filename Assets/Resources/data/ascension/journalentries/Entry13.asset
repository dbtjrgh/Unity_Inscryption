  bodyText1: No one will ever play this mod and, the way things are looking, they might never even play this game. But I'm gonna indulge in a fantasy.
  bodyText2: Thousands of players play it and love it. They each find different reasons to love it and even love its imperfections. They make music and art about it that makes me see my own work in a different way. But even a simple comment can have this effect. It makes me feel like all my work mattered and then some. I am overflowing with gratitude.
  bodyText3: ...Well, time to finish up the Squirrel Fish challenge. Maybe I'll hit up Comics Land later.
