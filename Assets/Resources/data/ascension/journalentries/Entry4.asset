  bodyText1: I scoured the disk last night looking for some kind of explanation. And I found some really wild stuff. It made me think... what is the OLD_DATA and why does Leshy only talk about it when he's wearing The Woodcarver's mask?
  bodyText2: I found some log from Mr. Kaminski. It was pretty clear when I met him that the guy had issues... but he seemed to be saying in this log that the entire development of Inscryption was a cover. For what? How infuriating if true.
  bodyText3: Time to start another run I guess.
