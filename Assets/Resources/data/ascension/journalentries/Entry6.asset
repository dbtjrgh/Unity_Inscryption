  bodyText1: Work on the mod continues. I was appalled to find that Leshy chose to use the Kaycee Hobbes' ghoul skull as a trinket on his shelf. He fills it with teeth for the Trapper after every boss... Kinda lame because it's tedious to keep getting up from the table just to collect the teeth. I'll have to hack that out. He'll hate me for it.
