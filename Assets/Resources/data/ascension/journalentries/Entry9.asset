  bodyText1: Today I found out what happened to P03... Leshy turned The Scrybe of Technology into a Stoat card. I found the card on the shelf below the safe and laughed right out loud when it told me it was P03 and needed help. I handed it over to Leshy who was less amused. I guess this is the fate that the other Scrybes met... though I haven't seen them yet.
